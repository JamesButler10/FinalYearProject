# FinalYearProject
Within the AU-AIRTranslation folder there are the files required to translate the AU-AIR dataset (found at https://bozcani.github.io/auairdataset) in to yolov4 format. vggToYolo tranlsates the file to the correct bounding box format and auAirFilter translates it to match the coco annotations. cocoTranslation contains similar files for the COCO dataset (found at https://cocodataset.org/#download). cocoToYolo translates the coco format in to the yolov4 format, creating a txt file for each image. Remap box updated records to the correct class numbers. removeLine removed records of classes not required. Finally cocofilter deleted any file that had no relevant records within it. The tracking folder contains alteration required for the Deepsort tracking code. The Deepsort tracking code found at https://github.com/theAIGuysCode/yolov4-deepsort.git is required for the code to run. Requirements-gpu contains an update list of required libraries to run the analysis. The other files contained within the folder contain updated code required for the implamented functions of the system.
